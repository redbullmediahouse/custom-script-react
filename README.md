1. Install the development dependencies with `npm i`
1. Run the development environment with `npm run serve`
1. Go to https://localhost:8080 and accept the exception of the self signed SSL certificate (or if you are using chrome activate chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost)
1. Try your script on https://staging.redbull.com/pl-ay/local/8080/bundle.js
1. Once you're done, compile your bundle for production with `npm run build`
